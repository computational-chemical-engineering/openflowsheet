"""ExternalFunction holders: the one place a TRF run reaches a black box (M05 design note §6.3;
ADR 0038 D5; R-262).

There is one `EFHolder` per black box — per property block and per external link — and every
`ExternalFunction` of that box calls through it. What the holder guarantees is what the probe found
TRF does not (design note §4):

- **Identity under clone.** TRF works on `model.clone()`, which deep-copies whatever a callback is
  bound to, so a ledger kept on a bound method's owner sees none of TRF's calls (probe P2′: 0 of
  23). `__deepcopy__` returns the holder itself, and the callables handed to Pyomo are closures,
  which `deepcopy` treats atomically; both together keep one holder, one memo and one ledger.
- **Exact-key memo.** Values and Jacobians are memoized on the exact binary64 inputs (canonical
  bytes, signed zeros normalized as ADR 0001 D1.5 requires of every state key), never quantized.
- **Never a non-finite value.** TRF accepts a NaN silently and reports optimal (probe P7), so a
  non-finite output — or input — is a refusal, never a return value.
- **Typed refusals.** A property block's `DomainError`, a truth's non-`ok` status, a non-finite
  value and an exhausted budget each raise `TruthRefused`. TRF has no evaluation-failure path (probe
  P6): the exception ends the run and the runner maps it to `TRF_TRUTH_REFUSED(<status>:<reason>)`.
  A refused key is remembered, so asking again re-raises without a second evaluation, and every
  refusal is kept on the holder: Pyomo 6.10.1's `EFReplacement.exitNode` swallows *any* exception
  raised by the start-value evaluation (a bare `except:` that sets the holder variable to 0), so
  the runner must find a refusal there even when TRF did not see it.
- **Budget.** Before every cold value request the holder admits it against every cap it was given
  for the run; a refused admission raises `TruthRefused("budget", "budget_exhausted")` and is not a
  request. A cap is therefore never exceeded.
- **Ledger.** Every request — a value or a Jacobian, cold or a memo hit — appends one
  `HolderRequest`. The TRF iteration it belongs to is read from the run's `RunState`, which the log
  handler advances (`trf_state.TrfLogHandler`); the first value request at a key in a run is given
  its purpose from TRF 6.10.1's fixed call order (design note §8.3).

This module imports neither Pyomo nor any truth: it is exercised in the default gate.
